# NBA Project
This is a project created by myself that shows how Centers and Power forwards have and will continue to become the dominant force in the NBA using R. 
I plan on expanding this project with recent data on MVPs and top players on the best teams, and how these players tend to be big men, such as the recent exposure of Nikola JokiÄ‡ and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Hence, the additon of the NBA MVPs and Finals data. The data citations are in the RMD file.
